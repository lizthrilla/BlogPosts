Bam Bam Bigelow is pretty much my spirit animal.

I've been working on this profile site for a couple of months. It started as a simple port of a static profile site I had made into Rails because I wanted to add a stripe button so that freelance employers would be able to pay me. But then a friend and fellow rails developer was like, "You have a blog on Wordpress? Dude, you know that Rails is essentially designed to make blogs. It looks super bad for a Rails developer to have a blog that is not on a Rails app. So I took his advice and added a blog, and another developer told me to write a testing suite, so that's coming too. For now, this is the first time the site has gone live, so please poke around, tell me if anything breaks, and let me know if you have any suggestions.

*Cheers*,
Michael Nash
