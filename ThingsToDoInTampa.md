# Things to Do in the "Other" Bay Area

## Tampa Side

### Excursions

- [Tampa Theatre](http://tampatheatre.org/)

  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [22.9 mi](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+Mirror+Lake+Drive+North,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/Tampa+Theatre,+711+N+Franklin+St,+Tampa,+FL+33602/@27.8646345,-82.6303125,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2c489880ac7f7:0xb7d9e2439de8207f!2m2!1d-82.458954!2d27.95034)

  Notes: A restored Moorish Art Deco oddity from the 30s, the Tampa Theatre is probably the coolest building in Tampa, and one of Liz and I's favorites. See a movie or a show or something.

- [Busch Gardens](https://buschgardens.com/tampa/)

  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [31 mi](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+Mirror+Lake+Drive+North,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/Busch+Gardens+Tampa+Bay,+N+McKinley+Drive,+Tampa,+FL/@27.9062359,-82.6802528,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2c64f0d381a85:0xa8a5fe0830e10852!2m2!1d-82.4211522!2d28.0379618)

  Notes: Come see the place where I worked the whole time I was in high school! Started out as a small annex to the Busch Brewery, has grown into "the Kmart of amusement parks". I haven't been in years, but they used to have a pretty solid zoo and actually great roller coasters. As a bonus this is in walking distance from out actual house so if you want to swing by the week before or after the wedding, you can meet us for breakfast or dinner and potentially park your car in our yard.

- [Bayshore Boulevard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayshore_Boulevard)

  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [18.5 mi](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+Mirror+Lake+Drive+North,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/Bayshore+Blvd,+Tampa,+FL/@27.8647935,-82.6315126,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2dca081e55cfb:0xd8f4f03d5bfc455b!2m2!1d-82.4857318!2d27.8867803)

  Notes: Billed as the longest continuous sidewalk in the world, but I've never seen the actual numbers on that. People bike and jog on it, but even if you are allergic to exercise you probably should drive down it as it is a pretty iconic view. As a bonus, the [Gasparilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasparilla_Pirate_Festival) pirate ship is usually docked there out of Gasparilla season.

- [University of Tampa/Henry B. Plant Museum](http://www.plantmuseum.com/)

  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [23.4 mi](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+Mirror+Lake+Drive+North,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/Henry+B.+Plant+Museum,+West+Kennedy+Boulevard,+Tampa,+FL/@27.8646345,-82.6303125,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2c48f50cea035:0xe4bfc9a636464c21!2m2!1d-82.464194!2d27.946538)

  Notes: Another awesome 1930s Moorish art deco building, the Henry B. Plant museum (formerly the Tampa Bay Hotel) on the University of Tampa campus is another iconic tampa sight. I've literally never been in side but you should still drive by it because it's a cool looking building.

## St.Pete Side

### Excursions

- [The Dali Museum](http://thedali.org/)

  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [1.3 mi](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+Mirror+Lake+Drive+North,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/The+Dali+Museum,+1+Dali+Blvd,+St.+Petersburg,+FL+33701/@27.8646345,-82.6303125,12z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e191ce90a0c9:0x273b948e64dcd305!2m2!1d-82.6314354!2d27.7659901)

  Notes: I have no idea why it's here, but this is the biggest collection of pieces by surrealist painter Salvador Dali this side of the Atlantic. Also, literally within walking distance of both the venue and the hotel.

- [Sunken Gardens](http://www.stpete.org/attractions/sunken_gardens/index.php)

  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [1.4 mi](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+559+Mirror+Lake+Dr+N,+St.+Petersburg,+FL+33701/Sunken+Gardens,+4th+Street+North,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/@27.7816944,-82.6501051,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1657e0a9257:0x70d77b2754fc7557!2m2!1d-82.6384152!2d27.7895824)

  Notes: Super retro tourist attraction that's just a big sinkhole with plants growing in it. I think they have a bird show. Was almost our wedding venue until we saw the price tag. Also probably within walking distance of the hotel.

- [Clearwater Beach](https://www.visitstpeteclearwater.com/communities/clearwater-beach)

  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [24.7](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+Mirror+Lake+Drive+North,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/Clearwater+Beach,+Clearwater,+FL/@27.828638,-82.8477811,10.74z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e948cae1c0d5:0xa2a27a0b28eb9f12!2m2!1d-82.8270846!2d27.9775301)

  Notes: Clearwater Beach is pretty consistently ranked amongst the best beaches in the country. They are also amongst the most popular and therefore crowded, though I don't know what that will be like in December. I've never quite gotten the hype (I prefer beaches that are less crowded like at Fort DeSoto below), but if you are a beach connoisseur this is probably the one you're interested in.

- [Fort De Soto Park](http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/05_ft_desoto.htm)
  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [14.5](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+559+Mirror+Lake+Dr+N,+St.+Petersburg,+FL+33701/Fort+De+Soto+Park,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/@27.6536406,-82.7354588,12z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c31b5b92af0bbb:0xa872b4e4c3759544!2m2!1d-82.7189421!2d27.6326329)

  Notes: Fort De Soto has a cool Spanish-American War era fort as well as some pretty pristine beaches. Tends to not be as crowded as Clearwater Beach above.

- [Sunshine Skyway Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Skyway_Bridge)
  Distance from Shuffleboard Club: [13.4](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Petersburg+Shuffleboard+Clb,+559+Mirror+Lake+Dr+N,+St.+Petersburg,+FL+33701/Sunshine+Skyway+Bridge,+Interstate+275,+Saint+Petersburg,+FL/@27.6988959,-82.729149,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c2e1820b13a015:0xc143aab8b6bcbb90!2m2!1d-82.6412416!2d27.7755088!1m5!1m1!1s0x88c31be448040d33:0x80be62b805455b74!2m2!1d-82.6557137!2d27.6204349)

  Notes: If you're into bridges, and I know you are, this one's a doozy. A bit weird to tell you take a big bridge across the bay just to turn around and come back, but there's not much of interest on the other side and the view and the bridge are totally worth it.
