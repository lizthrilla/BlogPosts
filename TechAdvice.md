Hi Trish --

So, I started with almost no coding background and went through a bootcamp called The Iron Yard.  TIY is regional, but these coding bootcamps exist all over the place. I'm not sure what your location is, so I can't give you much advice about which one to choose, but they are all pretty similar. TiY was a big time commitment and expensive, but it was very valuable for establishing connections with the community, and it was ultimately through a recommendation from them I got my current job as an Integration Developer.

A couple of caveats though. Since there aren't really any certifications or anything, basically what you are buying when you go to these things is knowledge and connections. You can get both elsewhere and more cheaply; it's just a matter of how much structure and people pointing you in the right direction you need. By the same token, you can go through one of these programs and come out unemployable (I know several people who did). Basically if you go in, you have to give it your all and make sure that you come up with something great for your final project so that you can present it to potential employers.

All that said, here are a couple of pieces of advice to get you started. I develop on a Mac using Linux, and developing on PC is a completely different animal that I don't know much about. All of this advice is assuming you go out and buy a MacBook Pro if you don't already have one.

1) Make connections with the developers in your community. Tampa, for example, has the Suncoast Developer's Guid (which contains Suncoast.js and The Tampa Ruby Brigade as part of it''s greater umbrella). Alternatively, you can just troll Meetup.com for local meetups for Ruby, Python, Javascript, or Java. Coding meetups are great for meeting people that can help you with specific coding problems, and they are also crucial for making connections that can get you a job later. Most new hires (at least in Tampa) get in through word of mouth.

2) Learn linux command line. There are a couple of skills indirectly related to coding that you need to know pretty thoroughly before you start actually doing much coding. Codecademy has a pretty good command line tutorial.  All of your basic programming stuff is going to be activated through the command line, so you pretty much have to know it.

3) Get a text editor that you like. All of your coding is going to be done through a text editor with code syntax highlighting. I use Atom, but it's not terribly user friendly. For a beginner, I recommend Sublime Text for maximum user friendliness.

4) Learn git. git is a command line based Version Control system which is pretty universally used for keeping track of code changes in industry. There's a tutorial on codecademy. There's also a some good tutorials over on Github guides.

5) Get a profile up on Github.  Github is a hosting site for open source code projects, so when you actually start coding you want to have something impressive up on there. Your Github profile is the main thing that a potential employer is going to look at as evidence that you know what you are doing. It also helps if you make contributions to other open source projects on Github.

6) Pick a programming language and learn it well. For starting out your choices are basically Ruby, Python, and Javascript. There's a high demand for Javascript, but it's very difficult to learn. Python has a a high demand, and it's easy to learn, and it has a lot of tooling. Ruby is a really elegant language and it's easy to learn, and I like it a lot, but it's not as easy to get a job in. (That said, Ruby has Rails, which is a web application platform that's very easy to pick up). I recommend codecademy for the sort of beginner stuff on those languages. Once you have the basics down, I recommend moving up to exercism or possibly the Euler Project for more advanced coding problems.

7) Build a web app. Once you have the language down you want to be able to actually do something with it. The most popular option is to build a web app. Ruby on Rails is relatively easy to learn, and there is Django for Python and Node.js for Javascript. This step is the most complicated, but there are a lot of guides and courses and books for how to do it.

8) Get your web app live. For fast and easy app hosting nothing beats Heroku.

Hopefully this helps,
let me know you have any other questions.
Cheers,
Michael Nash
