# How we met -- Michael

In fall of 2015 I was involved in an outlaw weightlifting group at USF run by this guy named Austin.
I had recently completed The Iron Yard code school and was looking, somewhat unsuccessfully, for a position as a junior developer.
Austin had taken an interest in my personal life, and was regularly inviting me out to parties and the like.
His girlfriend was involved with a Roller Derby team called the Bradentucky Bombers.
One week he suggested that I come down to Bradenton to see a derby bout with him on Saturday because I needed to meet this girl that was on the Bombers.
I was focused on becoming a better developer and my career in general, but I also didn't have anything better to do on a Saturday so I agreed to come down to the derby bout.
At the bout after-party (at Motorworks in Bradenton), I kinda awkwardly sat in a corner surrounded by slightly terrifying women I didn't know while Austin awkwardly tried to set Liz and I up. She didn't seem to be feeling it and I was not interested in a relationship so it didn't go super well. Liz and a some friends left Motorworks for a club in Sarasota (called the Gator club).
