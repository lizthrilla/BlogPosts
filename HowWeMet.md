# How we met -- Michael

In fall of 2015 I was involved in an outlaw weightlifting group at USF run by this guy named Austin. I had recently completed The Iron Yard code school and was looking, somewhat unsuccessfully, for a position as a junior developer.
Austin had taken an interest in my personal life, and was regularly inviting me out to parties and the like.

His girlfriend was involved with a Roller Derby team called the Bradentucky Bombers. One week he suggested that I come down to Bradenton to see a derby bout with him on Saturday because I needed to meet this girl that was on the Bombers.

I was focused on becoming a better developer and my career in general, but I also didn't have anything better to do on a Saturday so I agreed to come down to the derby bout.

At the bout after-party (at Motorworks in Bradenton), I kinda awkwardly sat in a corner surrounded by slightly terrifying women I didn't know while Austin awkwardly tried to set Liz and I up. She didn't seem to be feeling it and I was not interested in a relationship so it didn't go super well. Liz and a some friends left Motorworks for a club in Sarasota (called the Gator club). Austin encouraged me to go and I did. I did the awkward white guy dance for a while, but things didn't go super well here either. I did have a nice chat with Liz on a random couch at the club, but when we left the club we went our separate ways with no plans to see eachother again.

Fast forward to November. I had just gotten back from 2 weeks of training in Beverly Hills at my first professional software developer gig. It was the Global Day of Coderetreat (a weird programmer event) and I had gotten up super early to drive to St. Petersburg to take part in the event at The Iron Yard. It was roughly 10:30 P.M. on a Saturday, but between the travel and getting up early I was pretty exhausted and was planning to turn in early. I started receiving practically incoherent text messages from Austin. I ignored the first couple, but eventually he called me and I was able to piece together that the Derby team was having a big party in Bradenton and Liz had asked him where I was, and that he has promised her I would be there. I asked myself if I really wanted to do drive an hour down to Bradenton to meet a girl that hadn't seemed that interested in meeting me the first time, but only after I had already climbed into my truck and started off. This time I left with her number.

When we started dating we had the awkward situation of me living in Tampa and her living with her parents in Punta Gorda. At the beginning we were meeting to go on dates in, like, Sarasota or Bradenton. This became problematic very quickly, and one weekend Liz told me that she couldn't leave her parents house that weekend because of work, so if I wanted to see her I needed to drive down and stay at her parents place. I think my decision that I would rather go through the process of meeting her parents at... fairly early in the relationship than not see Liz that weekend was when I realized that we were looking at something serious. I guess I haven't looked back since.
