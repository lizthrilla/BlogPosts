# How we met -- Michael

In fall of 2015 I was involved in an outlaw weightlifting group at USF run by this guy named Austin.
I had recently completed The Iron Yard code school and was looking, somewhat unsuccessfully, for a position as a junior developer.
Austin had taken an interest in my personal life, and was regularly inviting me out to parties and the like.
His girlfriend was involved with a Roller Derby team called the Bradentucky Bombers.
One week he suggested that I come down to Bradenton to see a derby bout with him on Saturday because I needed to meet this girl that was on the Bombers.
I was focused on becoming a better developer and my career in general.
